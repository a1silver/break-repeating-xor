# Break Repeating XOR

This repository holds my code for Sunset High School's Cybersecurity final project that follows [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/)'s cryptography problems.  Problems 1-6 from [Set 1](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1) are covered.

To run this project:
 - Download this repository with whatever method you prefer
 - Open the project in IntelliJ or any IDE that supports IntelliJ projects
 - Attach a Java SDK with a minimum version of 18.0.2 (IntelliJ should automatically prompt you)
